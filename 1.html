            (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web

    <p>This document defines Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a new type of identifier that enables verifiable,
        decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the
        controller of the DID decides that it identifies. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been
        designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
        authorities. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions
        associated with that subject. Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or
        services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. Please read
        our Press Release to learn more about this tool to empower everyone on the web with privacy-respecting online
        identity and consent-based data sharing.</p>
